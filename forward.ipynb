    "# Getting started with neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we're going to take a first look at neural networks. Neural networks are a model constructed of a large combination of artificial neurons. We can use logistic regression as the building block for each of these artificial neurons and create a whole network of logistic regression units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is not the only building block we could use, there are a lot of different types of units and connections used in neural networks. However, logistic regression is the block that was historically used in the first neural networks, and in many ways, it is the most intuitive regression unit to create such a network with. So, for this assignment, we'll build some neural networks using only logistic regression units. In the language of neural networks, we're building a fully connected neural network with sigmoid activations at every layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notion of combining several elemental building blocks or *modules*, in\n",
    "order to create a more complex network, is at the heart of neural networks. In\n",
    "fact, many of the recent advances in AI come from *deep* neural networks, which\n",
    "means they are the result of combining **a lot** of these modules. So, building\n",
    "the modules in such a way that we can easily stack many of them, will be\n",
    "essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment consists of three parts. In the first part you will learn more about modularity. You will re-implement logistic regression, but now in such a way that it can be used as a module in a neural network. In the second part you will use this logistic regression module to build a neural network. In the last part you will have a look at how you could implement the training of a single logistic regression module. This last part sets you up for the next module in which you will learn how to deal with the training of a complete neural network."

    "### Logistic Regression, change 2: implemented as a Python class\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient descent algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we implement logistic regression as a class, it is good to think about its specifications. All gradient descent algorithms (e.g., linear and logistic regression) follow the same pattern: \n",
    "\n",
    "- They all predict some output $y$ based on some input $X$ (the _forward_ pass).\n",
    "- There is some cost function (loss) that allows us to quantify how good our current predictions are.\n",
    "- They all compute some gradient that tells us how we should change the parameters of the model to give better predictions next time (the _backward_ pass).\n",
    "- There is some form of gradient descent in which we take a step in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous modules you implemented these steps for both linear and logistic regression using separate variables and functions. This made running the algorithm and managing the data quite messy. The idea of using a class is that we can bundle all of this together and make running the descent algorithm much cleaner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we implement the class, let's have a look at how it is *intended to be used*. What we would like is that (once the class is defined) we can create a new logistic regression model and set the initial values of the learning parameters ($\\mathbf{w}$ and $b$) by simply creating a new instance. For example, if we want to have a logistic model with 4 inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_model = Logistic(4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if we want do a step of the gradient descent algorithm for some input `X` and some given output `y`, we want to be able to do something like this:\n",

    "    # predict the output for X\n",
    "    my_model.forward(X)\n",

    "    # compute the gradients\n",
    "    my_model.backward(y)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # update the learning parameter w and b, using a learning rate alpha\n",
    "    my_model.step(alpha)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that nowhere above you see any variables representing the learning parameters or the gradients. This is the crucial part: they are encapsulated inside the class. So once the class is defined we don't have to think about them anymore. Those details will be abstracted away by our design. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function `optimize()` is the function that will run the gradient descent given the model that you will implement. The function `optimize()` is already implemented a little bit further down. Have a look at it, you will see it implements the logistic algorithm exactly as described here. However, it will not work yet, because the implementation of the class `Logistic` is not finished yet. This is left up to you to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class specification\n",
    "\n",
    "As we established, all gradient descent algorithms are very similar and so the classes implementing them will all look very similar. We can rely on the previously mentioned commonalities to define a general template for any of those algorithms. We will agree that any class that represents a gradient descent module, will implement the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__`, set initial learning parameter.\n",
    "- `forward`, given some input $x$ predict an output $\\hat{y}$.\n",
    "- `backward`, compute all gradients of the parameters (given the output $\\hat{y}$ computed in `forward`, and the target value $y$).\n",
    "- `step`, update all parameters (based on the gradients computed in `backward`, and a learning rate `alpha`).\n",
    "- `cost`, compute the cost (given the output $\\hat{y}$ computed in `forward`, and the target value $y$).\n",
    "\n",

    "As you have learned from Andrew's videos, classic neural networks consist of multiple logistic layers. Each layer is essentially Logistic Regression, but instead of one single output, a logistic layer can have multiple outputs. And those outputs serve as the inputs for the next layer.\n",

    "So, let's say we want to create a logistic layer that outputs $o$ values labeled $y_1, y_2, \\ldots y_o$. One way you could theoretically accomplish this is by just creating $o$ different logistic regression units with $o$ individual $\\mathbf{w}$ parameters, and $o$ individual $b$ parameters, that all operate on the input $x$, like so:\n",

    "\n",
    "Next week we're going to learn how you can train neural networks in general. But let's glance into the future and look at how we can train **a single** logistic layer. For single layer neural networks, learning the parameters, $W$ and $b$, is very similar to learning $\\theta$ with logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The single layer network takes a vector of inputs for a sample and produces a vector of predictions (instead of just one prediction per sample, as with logistic regression). This vector of predictions corresponds with multi-class classification, with each output learning a separate *one-vs-all* classifier; one classifier to recognize each of the classes that needs to be distinguished. This means that learning the parameters for the whole neural network will, in the case of a *single layer*, just correspond learning several logistic regression outputs \"next to each other\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### As a computational graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with logistic regression, we use'll the cross entropy loss $l$. However, since the output of the logistic layer is a vector of predictions, the equation for the cost will also have to change accordingly.  To determine the combined cost for all these one-vs-all classifiers, you can just sum the individual cost for each of the outputs together, and compute the total cost that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "At every training step we would like to calculate how much every weight in $W$ and $b$ should change to decrease this total loss. For this we need to compute the gradients $\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial W}$ and $\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial b}$. In the computational graph below we added these gradients:\n",

    "<img src=\"src/Multi layer NN back.svg\" width=\"39%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The math\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, since the output of the logistic layer is not a single value, but a vector, the equations for the gradients are also slightly different to those of logistic regression. If you work out the math, you will see that the difference boils down to doing an extra summation over the outputs. The details are for next week. For now, we will just provide you with the resulting equations:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\frac{\\partial J_{W,b}}{\\partial b}$ is simply the sum of all the rows of the $m \\times o$ matrix $\\hat{Y} - Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can verify for yourself that this is congruent with logistic regression by taking the output dimension $o = 1$ (i.e., you can take $Y$ and $\\hat{Y}$ to be vectors of size $m$ instead of $m \\times o$ matrices). If you work out the math for yourself, you will see that the above equations become identical to those of logistic regression."

    "Use the formulas above to define the `LogisticLayer` class here below. The `init` is already given and you can copy the `forward` method from the earlier version of `LogisticLayer` from *Assignment 2*. You'll need to add the missing methods `backward`, `step`, and `cost` to this `LogisticLayer` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all these functions, so `forward`, `backward`, `step`, and `cost`, should work in exactly the same way as they do for the `Logistic` class from *Assignment 1*, except that they should implement these operations for the entire layer of outputs, instead of a single node. Specifically, each function should be implemented in such a way that they can be used by *same* `optimize` function from earlier, also used for the `Logistic` class, with only the model instance changing. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, most of these functions will need to store some intermediate results in the object instance, which can then be used by later function calls. For example, the `backward` function should store the passed `Y` matrix, making it possible to later compute the `cost` for that same `Y`, without needing to provide it as an argument. Take a good look at what arguments the functions from the `Logistic` class exactly take, and which attributes they store, and use that as a starting point for your `LogisticLayer` implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of `backward` only has to work for a single layer, for which the gradient equations are given above. You can reuse the code from logistic regression from earlier, but care should be taken in the vectorization. Since the there are now $o$ different outputs, the vectorized version will produce an $m \\times o$ matrix of predictions $\\hat{Y}$, which means ($\\hat{Y} - Y$) in the gradient computation is now also an $m \\times o$ matrix, instead of just a vector of size $m$. As a result, you'll need to make some changes in your implementation to keep all of the vectorized dimensions correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same applies for the `cost` function, which should now also work for multiple output nodes. This requires an extension of the original logistic regression cost, namely adding an extra sum over all the output nodes, so the resulting cost will still be a single scalar combining all the different outputs. This cost will be introduced in more detail in the theory videos of next week, but can be defined as\n",

    "where $K$ is the total number of outputs, $y^{(i)}_k$ is the $k^{th}$ target output of the $i^{th}$ sample, and $\\hat{y}^{(i)}_k$ is the $k^{th}$ predicted output for the $i^{th}$ input sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we're now combining multiple output nodes, the implementation of this cost cannot easily be written as a matrix multiplication anymore. So, you should instead write this cost function using elementwise operations, where the elements of both matrices are only multiplied/added/etc when all the indices match (check the *Numpy* notebook if you're unsure how to use these). The result of doing these elementwise operations will then still be an $m \\times k$ matrix, which you can just combine and reduce to a scalar using `np.sum`.\n",

    "In this module we've looked at several different ways to modularize logistic regression, combining it into logistic layers with multiple logistic outputs. Then we took these logistic layer modules and stacked them together, connecting the outputs of one layer to the inputs of the next. This created a network that is capable of solving much more complex problems than just a single logistic layer, if we set the weights correclty. Lastly, we looked at a version of a single logistic layer, where the weights could be trained directly using gradient descent.\n",

These networks can then learn how to solve more complex problems like the XOR or digit recognition using several logistic layers linked together. "
